This was my problem statement for my Coursework Document, that'll likely explain what I intended to do with this project. This is temporary until I have finished the project and add proper README documentation

This project aims to tackle the boundaries of learning the new OCR GCSE Computer Science J277 specification which has existed since 2020 with its first assessment in 2022. This GCSE examination is taken across two papers. Paper 1 is labelled as “Computer Systems” and Paper 2 is labelled as “Computational Thinking, Algorithms and Programming”.

Below is the content of both papers and their specification points

Let’s focus on the student side of the problem statement initially.

An initial problem with such a newly designed specification is the lack of any valuable resources which provide students access to top level revision. There are sites which allow for students to read notes such as SaveMyExams or Physics And Maths Tutor but provide lacklustre progress tracking methods for the students. For example, SaveMyExams only tracks the notes you’ve read and whether you’ve actually answered the question or not and not other statistics like its difficulty, how long you spent or strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, some sites are restricted to teachers only but allow for tracking of progress such as OCR’s own ExamBuilder (acceptable since this is supposed to be a teacher only resource for creating exams) and SmartRevise (Craig And Dave’s solution to computer science revision but is limited by the fact it’s a very expensive paid resource). This means there isn’t a cohesive resource which allows students to revise effectively and track crucial statistics which will aid them in revising. A lot of students are left in the dark about their own progress and achievement as a result and means students cannot target their revision to the hard topics and are left to assume what is difficult and what isn’t. The only effective data they can use to assess this is conducting in-class mock exams which happen infrequently and teachers can’t spend much time marking them and providing comprehensive feedback as there are so many students in one class majority of the time. So again, the students do not get tailored feedback - only a mark and percentage which tells them what grade they got and how well overall they did rather than on individual specification points. Some sort of revision resource is needed for students to revise and track their progress and allow for their revision to be tailored to their needs.

Another problem of such a specification for computer science is the lack of enthusiasm for revising. The idea of the GCSE is that it is a method of assessing student achievement and recognising their ability to remember the content and effectively apply it to certain scenarios within the paper. The questions are designed to effectively challenge students. However, the process of revising the GCSE content itself is laborious and tiring for most. There lacks the enthusiasm and motivation to revise since most resources themselves are merely pages of notes with a few lacklustre questions at the end. There needs to be a resource where students can access notes and videos and then perform questions in timed conditions whilst also providing helpful motivation by tracking their progress. Whether it’s how long they spend on questions or their success rate on questions, it has to show the student what they find harder and easier and help them tailor their revision. Whilst this links to the issue above, the idea of this is to guide students through the specification and reward achievement with the progress features and motivate them to revise the GCSE content easily and effectively so that the issue of revision being “boring” is removed.

Now let’s look at the teacher’s side of the problem. For them, the main issue is being unable to create effective lessons. There aren't enough resources out there for teachers to analyse student progress and see which topics they are struggling with. This sort of data could be useful for teachers to plan lessons around this data. Most teachers tend to blindly tackle topics and see how it goes via the use of exam data and homeworks. However, this data can only be retrieved infrequently meaning that the strengths and weaknesses of an individual student, classes and cohorts. A revision resource can help teachers identify this data with higher success rates with students logging on and their question/answer progress data modified at regular intervals which can be used for teachers to plan lessons and exams around it. This can be done in the form of a teacher setting homework with the app This project aims to be targeted more specifically at student learning but teachers being able to track progress should have another focal side to it.

To summarise, the overall problem statement can be viewed as a resource which makes the revising for the summer exams for computer science much easier through means of progression and reward whilst the students can strengthen their abilities by being able to target areas of weakness and strengths. Let us create a brief for such a problem:
To allow students to revise for their Computer Science Exams through notes, videos and multiple choice questions and 
To allow students and teachers to track their progress overtime through means of
Feedback & Statistical Analysis
Graphs and charts of time and accuracy data
To motivate students into revising by rewarding achievements such as a fast attempt at answering a question or getting top marks in a practice test
To allow teachers to set homework for students (class) and monitor progress
To allow teachers to monitor student and class progress given the data provided by the app which allows them to effectively plan each lesson out
