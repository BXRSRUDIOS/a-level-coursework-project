What is the key difference between iterative and final testing,Iterative is during development; final is on the complete product,Iterative finds logic errors; final finds syntax errors,Iterative is done by users; final is done by programmers,Iterative is automated; final is always manual,Medium,2.3,Iterative testing occurs throughout development to catch issues early. Final testing assesses the whole system against its requirements before release.
A function calculates area length x width. What is a logic error,Using addition instead of multiplication in the calculation,Forgetting a colon at the end of a function definition,Misspelling the word print in a message,The user entering text instead of a number,Medium,2.3,A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or logic. Using the wrong operator is a classic logic error. A missing colon is a syntax error. Misspelling print is also a syntax error. User input is an external factor.
How does defensive design relate to input validation,Input validation is a defensive technique to handle bad data,Input validation is only used after defensive design fails,Defensive design makes input validation unnecessary,Input validation is a type of authentication,Medium,2.3,Input validation is a core defensive design practice acting as a first line of defense against invalid or erroneous data that could cause program failure.
Why is a consistent naming convention important,It improves code readability and maintainability,It makes the code execute more efficiently,It prevents all runtime errors,It is required for the code to compile,Medium,2.3,Consistent naming eg camelCase for variables helps programmers quickly understand the purpose of identifiers making the code easier to modify and debug. It does not affect how the code runs.
What is the main advantage of testing iteratively,Bugs are found and fixed earlier when they are cheaper to resolve,It guarantees the final program will have no bugs,It is much faster than doing one final test,It means less documentation is required,Medium,2.3,Finding and fixing bugs early in the development cycle is significantly less costly and time-consuming than discovering them after the system is fully built.
What is the primary characteristic of erroneous test data,It is the wrong data type,It is a valid value but outside normal limits,It is a value on the edge of being valid,It is the most common input value,Medium,2.3,Erroneous data is defined by its incorrect data type eg entering text where a number is required. Invalid data is the correct type but wrong value.
After testing reveals a logic error what must a programmer do,Refine the algorithm and correct the code,Fix the spelling mistakes in the comments,Get the user to enter different data,Buy a faster computer to run the program,Medium,2.3,Logic errors reside in the codes algorithm. The programmer must debug the code locate the error and correct the logic. Other options do not address the root cause.
What does a test plan typically include for each test case,Test data expected result and purpose,The programmers name and the date,The cost of fixing a potential bug,The color scheme for the user interface,Medium,2.3,A test plan is a practical document that specifies what to test data why purpose and what should happen expected result to verify correctness.
In an authentication system what is a username used for,Identification,Verification,Validation,Encryption,Medium,2.3,A username is for identification stating who you are. The password is for verification proving it. Validation checks data encryption scrambles it.
What is the purpose of boundary testing,To check if the program handles extreme valid values correctly,To ensure the program only accepts the most common inputs,To verify the programs graphical layout,To test the program with completely random data,Medium,2.3,Boundary testing is crucial for finding off-by-one errors and ensuring the program correctly processes values at the limits of acceptance.
Which is a defensive design action for a score input,Validating that the score is a number between 0 and 100,Using a variable name like s to save time,Making sure the score calculation is done in a subprogram,Writing a comment that says input score here,Medium,2.3,Directly validating the input value is a defensive action against invalid data. Using a good variable name and subprograms aid maintainability and comments aid understanding but they dont directly defend against bad input.
What is the difference between invalid and erroneous data,Invalid is wrong value; erroneous is wrong data type,Invalid is wrong data type; erroneous is wrong value,Invalid is a boundary value; erroneous is a normal value,Invalid is always a number; erroneous is always text,Medium,2.3,Invalid data is of the correct type but an unacceptable value eg 150 for a 0-100 range. Erroneous data is of the wrong type eg hello for a numeric field.
Why is it important to test with normal boundary and invalid data,To comprehensively check how the program handles different inputs,To make the test plan look more detailed,Because normal data is the only type that matters,To ensure the program runs as slowly as possible,Medium,2.3,Thorough testing requires a range of inputs to ensure the program works correctly for valid data and fails gracefully for invalid data covering all scenarios.
What is a benefit of breaking a program into subprograms,Each subprogram can be tested independently iteratively,It forces the programmer to use more comments,It automatically removes any syntax errors,It means the program needs no input validation,Medium,2.3,Modular design through subprograms allows for unit testing—testing individual parts in isolation—which is a key part of iterative development.
If a program asks for a month 1-12 what is boundary data,1,0,13,January,Medium,2.3,Boundary data is at the edges of validity. 1 is the lower boundary. 0 and 13 are invalid and January is erroneous.

Validation deals with data ranges.
A program calculates a discount. 10percent for orders over £50. What is a logic error,Applying a 10percent discount to orders under £50,Misspelling the keyword if in the code,The user entering fifty instead of 50,The program crashing when no order value is entered,Hard,2.3,A logic error is a flaw in the algorithms decision-making. Applying the discount incorrectly is a logic error. A misspelled keyword is a syntax error. User input and crashes may be caused by a lack of validation.
How can a programmer anticipate misuse for a text-based menu options 123,Validate the input to ensure it is only 1 2 or 3,Use the most efficient sorting algorithm for the menu,Make sure the menu text is your favorite color,Write the menu code without using any subprograms,Hard,2.3,Anticipating misuse means expecting users to enter wrong data. Validation checks the input and handles non-123 values gracefully. Other options are irrelevant.
What is a key difference between a syntax error and a logic error,A syntax error prevents execution; a logic error allows execution but gives wrong results,A logic error prevents execution; a syntax error allows execution but gives wrong results,Both prevent execution but syntax errors are easier to fix,Both allow execution but logic errors are easier to find,Hard,2.3,Syntax errors are grammatical mistakes caught by the translator. Logic errors are mistakes in the programs design or reasoning; the code runs but produces incorrect output.
Why is invalid test data often more challenging to handle than erroneous data,Because the program must distinguish between wrong values and correct values of the same type,Because invalid data always causes the program to crash immediately,Because invalid data is always entered by malicious users,Because programming languages cannot check for invalid data,Hard,2.3,Handling invalid data requires the programs logic to check the value of correctly-typed data. Handling erroneous data often involves catching type conversion exceptions which may be managed by the language itself.
In a robust program what should happen when invalid data is entered,The program should reject it with a clear error message and ask for input again,The program should automatically correct the data to a valid value,The program should crash to alert the user strongly,The program should ignore the input and continue running silently,Hard,2.3,Defensive design dictates that programs should handle errors gracefully. This means informing the user of the mistake and allowing them to correct it without the program failing.
What is a significant benefit of maintainable code,It is easier and cheaper to fix bugs and add new features later,It is guaranteed to have no syntax errors,It will always run faster than less maintainable code,It does not require any testing before release,Hard,2.3,Maintainable code with good structure naming comments is easier to understand and modify reducing the long-term cost of software development and evolution.
A program uses a function to calculate tax. Why is this good practice,It localizes the tax logic making it easier to test and change,It makes the calculation run a thousand times faster,It means the tax rate doesnt need to be validated,It automatically makes the code object-oriented,Hard,2.3,Placing specific functionality in a subprogram modularity isolates it making it easier to debug test and modify eg if tax laws change without affecting other code.
When creating a test plan for a function what is essential to include,The expected output for a given set of inputs,The name of the programmer who wrote the function,The time of day the test should be run,the font size used in the code editor,Hard,2.3,The core of a test case is the input and the expected output. This provides a clear objective passfail criterion for the test.
What is the relationship between defensive design and testing,Defensive design tries to prevent errors; testing tries to find them,Testing is only needed if defensive design is poor,Defensive design makes testing unnecessary,Testing is the same thing as defensive design,Hard,2.3,Defensive design eg validation and testing are complementary strategies for producing quality software. Design prevents known issues while testing uncovers unknown issues.
Why is it important to test boundary conditions,Because many errors occur at the extreme ends of input ranges,Because boundary data is the most common type of input,Because it is the easiest type of test to perform,Because it is the only way to find syntax errors,Hard,2.3,Programs often have off-by-one errors or incorrect comparison operators eg using greater than instead of greater than or equal to that only surface when processing boundary values.
After terminal testing a logic error is found in the program. What does this imply,The test data used during iterativedevelopment testing did not cover this specific scenario,Iterative testing is a waste of time and should not be done,The programmers should have used more comments,The user should have been given a better manual,Hard,2.3,Finding a bug after release suggests the test cases data during development were not comprehensive enough to trigger the flawed logic. It highlights a gap in the test plan.
What is a robust program,A program that handles unexpected inputs or events without crashing,A program that has the most features,A program that uses the latest graphics technology,A program that is written in the fewest lines of code,Hard,2.3,Robustness is a key quality of software meaning it can cope with errors invalid inputs and other unexpected situations gracefully and reliably.
